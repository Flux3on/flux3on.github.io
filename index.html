    <p><i>I'll put some random messages here here like I did with the last website</i></p>
    <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to my WIP website! I am Flux3on (My friends call me Lucy), and I spawned in this world on October 31, 2003!
      I mainly play osu!, Minecraft, and ClassiCube, but I also run a private server that runs Geometry Dash 1.6! We have an
      actively growing community with over 250 members!</p>
    <p>I have a YouTube channel, where I document my top performances on osu! (and really whatever I want to) as time goes by, and my personal best
      is 126pp on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/b/173133">Straight LOVE</a> [Insane], composed by Nanahira (and a bunch 
      of other people), and mapped and submitted by <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/899031">Lami</a>.</p>
    <p>I have another YouTube channel, titled "1.6 GDPS" where I play and upload levels created by players on the 1.6 GDPS.</p>
